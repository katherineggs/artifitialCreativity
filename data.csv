" ""Billie Bossa Nova"" 's a little bit of a... fantasy... I don't even know what. We actually called this song ""Billie Bossa Nova"" because in... I wanna say like spring of 2019, my brother sent me a beat that he had made and he called it ""Billie Bossa Nova"" 'cause it was just a Bossa Nova type beat, and I was like ""that's amazing,"" and then, nothing happened for like a year and a half, um... and then... we listened to it again and kind of wrote this fantasy, romanticized, glorified dream."
" This song is a big bummer. It's really... about how... everybody dies. You can’t change it, and it's a horrible thought. But it's also a comforting thought? I don’t know, it, like, gives me comfort to know I'm gonna die, I don't know why. I talked a, I've talked about it since I was a kid. Makes me feel... happy that all things end. It's also very sad and sentimental. This song is really just about knowing that you only have so long to do what you want, so just do it and... enjoy your life."
" ""Getting Older"" was tough to write, you know, 'cause it's a very revealing song and it's talking about things that I, only at the time, had just felt like I realized about myself and felt insecure about, and wanted to talk about, and... I don't know, I think that that happens a lot and it should be completely... welcomed, is realizing stuff years later . You sometimes don't realize what's going on around you until a really long time later, or realize what you feel until years later."
" Um... ""GOLDWING"", I... wrote a song that is kind of a metaphor for, you know, a young woman, especially in the industry, or in... you know, life, that is pure, and I don't mean a virgin, I mean, like a young non-exploited, non-traumatized person. A metaphor for that being, you know, a goldwinged angel."
" ""Halley's Comet"". Y'know... ""Halley's Comet"" 's just about falling in love and feeling of, a feeling of... euphoria and... life kind of feeling like you're floating and... y'know. Love is a crazy crazy thing and, ""Halley's Comet"" 's just like a sweet little romantic song."
" ""Happier Than Ever""! Probably the most therapeutic song I've ever written or recorded? Like, ever, ever, ever? 'Cause I just screamed my lungs out and could barely talk afterwards which was very satisfying to me somehow? I had wanted to get those screams out for a very long time. And it was very nice, too.1"
" ""Didn't Change My Number""... I love this song so much. It's all about... you can't... get me anymore. Where it's like ""you know what? I don't sympathy for you anymore. You know, you got me, you got me at first but I don't care now,"" and it's really that, and that only. And, um... kind of just your last straw and being like ""I am confident in this being my last straw"" . You know, ""don't get me mad 'cause I will scream."""
" ""Lost Cause"", I mean, speaks for itself. Uh... you know, what do you want me to say? I ah...uh, I was thinking it and I said it . Yeah."
" ""Male Fantasy"" 's really... a hopeless realization? And a... horrible thing . It's terrible to feel... something that you don't want to feel. ""Happier Than Ever"" was actually gonna close the album, and then we wrote ""Male Fantasy"", and it actually... felt better to close it with that. You know, not ending on a... angry note, I think, was important, 'cause nothing shoud end on a bad note, I feel like."
" ""my future"" is a... I hold very close to my heart. It wasn't really the first song we wrote after the album but it was to me... like, it felt like the beginning of a new... ""world,"" and a new feeling. It's cute to me now because I listen to it and... the girl singing it —which is me then— is singing about me now, and that makes me feel good. I listen to it now thinking about the future future me, and it, it gives me hope and... excites me."
" ""NDA"" is kind of all over the map... it's got a lot of different things going on, that were completely different situations. It's really just, like, things that I was thinking and feeling and... doing in my life and I was like ""I'm just gonna write about it"" . Um... I don't know, I think it's very cool but... ""NDA"" is very... all over the place and up for interpretation, really."
" ""Not My Responsibility""... these are some of my favourite words I've ever written. And I feel like nobody listened , uh. It's all about body image and all the things we are trained to think and feel about bodies, and it just makes me laugh because I put it out and everyone was like ""yes, queen,"" ""body positivity,"" ""uh."" And then, like, three months later there's a picture of me in a tank top and the whole internet was like ""fat!"" So... ."
"Billie on OverHeated (Spotify Commentary) LyricsWe took the production from ""Not My Responsibility"" and made it into a beat, and then wrote ""OverHeated"", and it's really just about the same thing, y'know, why the fuck is it such a shock that I look like all of you? And I think that that's the funny thing, is the internet... you know, you feel so powerful and... somehow invisible at the same time? But... everybody sees it. You say crazy stuff on the internet thinking ""ah... nobody will see it"". It's really just about the... insanity of... paparazzi, and articles, and comment sections, and Twitter!"
" ""Oxytocin"" is a fun one, that's probably one of my favourites. We had all these songs and I was like ""only thing we're missing is... the song that's gonna be... purposefully insane live"". And we made ""Oxytocin"". Oh my god, it was the most satisfying thing in the world. We would, like, stand up and, like, jump around and see what felt... right. I was also just... going through crazy feelings at the time, too. And you can understand those if you listen to the lyrics ."
" ""Therefore I Am""...  it's funny, I've recently seen people talk about who they think it's about and I'm like ""what are you talking about?"" It's actually not about anybody I know, it's not about anybody that I've ever had a friendship or a relationship with, it's about people, types of people, and... yeah, I don't know, it's like, I'm not really gonna talk about what it's actually about, but it's just a fun one. It's just like a ""don't take me seriously"" song ."
" ""Your Power"". For me this is a... very personal meaning. I don't wanna talk about it but, um... you know, it was pretty sad when it came out and so many people came to me saying ""thank you for this song,"" it's crazy. I don't know one woman that hasn't been taken advantage of. I just think it should be talked about more because I think that... it's waaay too normalized how many young women are taken advantage of."

" Have you ever wondered what happens when you sleep, where you go and what you feel; the places that you seek? When you start to drift away, your mind becomes a book that writes itself, then fades away before you wake to look ; Tonight we’re going to think about anything you’d like. So, first let’s visualize some scenes to see us through the night. Settle back and clear your mind. We’re heading somewhere special, beyond the world of consciousness, to places more celestial ; I’d like you to imagine now you’re there beneath the stars. Which, when you pause to think about it, actually you are. As you focus on the darkness right before your eyes, feel the scenes with glinting lights to emulate night skies ; Think about the things you cherish most and those you love, and then allow yourself to be embraced from up above. The power of the universe meanders through your mind. So, come with me and let’s see what the two of us can find ; Let’s travel now to moonlit valleys blanketed with heather; the kind of landscape you and I could dream about forever. Imagine lazing on the ground, succumbing to the charms of blades of grass we now caress with fingertips and palms ; A gentle scent of cedar wood is floating on the breeze; a gift from mother nature and her nearby cedar trees. We’re gazing on the night sky now, marveling at infinity. So, allow your mind to wander to a peaceful, new vicinity ; Picture this: a rich green forest damp with morning dew. Inhale the morning air as we explore, just me and you. Leaves create mosaics in every shade of green, as gentle birdsong mingles with the babbling of a stream ; Dappled sepia sunlight cuts through branches of ahead, as dew drops fall from leaf to leaf, like glistening strands of thread. The dew drops finally coalesce forming satin beads. Occasionally they kiss our cheeks. Small pleasures; quenching needs ; Holding hands, we stroll, until we chance upon a brook. Its cool, clear water mirroring our faces as we look. A shimmering reflection shows us smiling from above. The world we think but dare not speak, is L-O-V-E; love ; Now, we snuggle on a raft and drift for endless hours. As willow trees sway in the breeze and blossoms fall in showers. Gently swaying to and fro, we look up at the sky and watch the clouds above us forming shapes as they pass by ; The wisps of cloud swirl slowly, tinged with tangerine and pink, and as they fade, the sunset give us cause to muse and think of places we should visit and the oceans we could cross. For some who wander through this world, there’s grace in being lost ; Passing by a waterfall, our thoughts sway to and fro, and time begins to fade and blur beneath the moon’s pale glow. A symphony of tumbling water, lulls and mesmerizes. Nature’s soundtracks to our dreams assumes so many geysers ; Strolling on a sidewalk now, as rain begins to fall. Its gentle pitter-patter holds us deep within its thrall. The raindrops rhythm briefly slows, then intensifies. Peaceful and benevolent; a gift from moonlit skies ; The fragrance the rain creates upon the concrete surface inspires, yet relaxes us and focuses our purpose to shift our minds to neutral and allow our thoughts to drift and recognize the rainfall as a mesmerizing gift ; Sheltering beneath the porch, we watch the rain pour down. But, now the time has come to leave this dreamy moonlit town. A gentle breeze wafts through the trees, and causes leaves to stir, and then the rain relents and fades as time begins to blur ; We find ourselves upon a shoreline, lounging by a lake. All crickets chirp in nearby reeds, it’s hard to stay awake. The scene feels like a watercolor; soft, diluted tones. As looking down we see each other laughing, skimming stones ; The stones skip on the gleaming lake and ripples start to form, and though the sun has dipped from view, we feel content and warm. Herons drift on thermals, high above the sun-bleached pier, and in the trees beyond the lake, we glimpse a passing deer ; Strands of cloud unfurl like ribbons in the orange sky. Mirrored on the lake now, like a painted butterfly. In the distance, mountains beckon, capped with pristine snow. The kind of sight that dreams evoke when hearts and minds let go ; You might also likeContemplating nothingness, a scene takes shape before us. And as it sharpens in our thoughts, we hear a distant chorus, the dampened sound of silence that only snow can bring, surrounds us with its calming vibes, and touches us within ; Glistening snowflakes fall in flurries. Mountain rivers freeze, the powdery slopes look beautiful, and fresh snow dusts the trees. Somehow, now, we’re in a cabin, taking in this view as the fire crackles in the corner just for me and you ; We linger for a moment, or maybe it’s been hours for when we blink and look again, our vistas waft in flowers. Another destination lulls us; closer now, it seems. Perhaps it’s real, or just another chapter in our dreams ; Drifting in and out of sleep, our thoughts take us elsewhere, to an island fringed by swaying palms, lush beyond compare. A path winds through the mangroves towards a distant beach, that underlines the turquoise ocean. Now, within our reach ; Eventually, we feel the powdery sand right beneath our feet. The sun above now blessing us with gentle, soothing heat. We hear the lilting sound of surf breaking up ahead, while spiral shells and pearly shards determine where we tread ; Finally, a lapping wave engulfs our sandy feet. It seems to pause and ruminate, then gradually retreat. We dig our toes in cool, wet sand. Then, sit and face the sea and let the sound wash over us. Alone, just you and me ; Staring at the nothingness that stretches on forever, our thoughts dovetail and unify in tune, two minds together. As minutes turn to hours, we drift off somewhere new and visualize a stairway to a door we now walk through ; Imagine now a meadow on a balmy afternoon. Birds, and bees, and rustling trees create a summer tune, flanked by fields of sunflowers. Hand-in-hand we walk as the gentle sound of nature surrounds us while we talk ; The sunflowers give the scenery a warm and golden hue, while hazy sunshine softens our idyllic, rustic view. As we roam past hedgerows, a farmhouse sits alone. Its open shutters pressed against uneven walls of stone ; A garden winds around the house and daisies poke through grass. A bench that’s lived through countless summers creeks as we walk past. We wonder if the house is empty; once loved, but no longer. The thought of passing time inspires a feeling that grows stronger ; This feeling washes over us, lost between a sight. And as the sun begins to set, we stop and wonder why gravity caresses us and pulls you close to me. Then, the scene begins to fade on new reality ; Deeper, gradually deeper, we drift and now transcend to unfamiliar places. Too surreal to comprehend. Slowly, we capitulate, as sleep begins to call. Entwined in dreams and shifting scenes, we drift and gently fall ; Friendly faces, glorious places, things we hope to do; intertwined with snapshots. Some of me, and some of you. Moonlit valleys, verdant forests, gazing at the ocean, summer meadows, tranquil sunsets, steeped in pure emotion ; The tenderness we feel when we are close, two minds as one, surrounds us and connects us. But, we’ve only just begun. For now, we dream together of all that is to follow. And now that sleep will keep us safe, for now until tomorrow ; Maybe all the memories that we’ve gathered here tonight are all dreams now remembered, or wishes in plain sight. No matter what, they’re with us now, for this night and forever. And every time we close our eyes, they’re yours and mine to treasure ; Goodnight, and sleep well1"

" When I was 20 years old, I was just starting out as a musician and I was in the time of my life when everything was kind of make-it-or-break-it and one night I was in Chicago, I was playing The Vic Theater and I was doing an event for Vevo, which is a really large social media platform. 33 million impressions which is a number I will never forget, because that night in Chicago, I had a miscarriage. I was 20 years old. I didn't even know I was pregnant and I had a miscarriage. I remember laying in a bed in a hotel room with a towel between my legs, bleeding and staring at my very young, very scared, very male managers who had no idea what was going on and I remember them looking at me and saying, ""I mean, it’s 33 million impressions, this concert is kind of a big deal."" So, I had a choice to make in that moment which was, whether I was going to let this experience play out the way it was probably supposed to, or if I was going to get out there and go on that stage. So I took a Percocet and put on an adult incontinence diaper and I wore a long t-shirt that would cover it and I got on stage and I performed in front of about 1,200 screaming teenage girls. There's videos of it online, if you want to go watch. ; It was in that moment that I realized that part of being a woman and dealing with reproductive health is being treated like you’re not a human, is being treated like you’re a robot and you’re supposed to wake up every day and get over it. But it was also in that moment that I realized that I could overcome anything and that if I wanted to pursue this career and I wanted this pursue this path, there was absolutely nothing that was going to get in my fucking way, excuse my language. ; I went to Planned Parenthood after because I was 20 years old and I was a struggling musician and we don't make a lot of money when you’re 20 years old and a struggling musician. Planned Parenthood was the only place that I knew that was safe, that I knew I could trust, that I could be treated like a person and given options and information and that is where I went. Shout out Planned Parenthood. And the biggest question was, why me at 20 years old? Perfectly healthy, able body, why would I have a miscarriage? And it was in that process that I found out that I had endometriosis and I had had painful periods my whole life. But it was something that I was kind of told was just something that women in our family deal with. I was told I was sensitive or over dramatic. I remember when I had my first job as a hostess at a restaurant and I remember clearing a table and taking a tray back into the kitchen and collapsing to the floor and rushing to the hospital and there was a lot of misdiagnoses along the way, PCOS, which I am sure a lot of people are familiar with as well but nobody really knew what was going on until I had that miscarriage. ; And it was shortly after that I met my current OB-GYN who is Dr. Aliabadi, out in LA and she is really, really incredible and she is one of my best friends because we see a lot of each other . I didn't know what was going on when I got my diagnosis and I had spent a lifetime tucking my tampons into the sleeve of my sweatshirt when I would go to the bathroom, god forbid anybody knew that I was menstruating because it was like the most shameful thing of all time. And now there was this. So, you take the most embarrassing thing that can happen to a woman, which is having a period, and you make it worse and that is a really tough pill to swallow. ; I was 21 and was realizing that there is a possibility that I wouldn’t be able to have kids and I spoke about it, I told my fans what I was going through about my diagnosis. I implored them to speak with their physicians and that if they were going through painful menstrual cycles, they needed to speak up because it’s not normal to be having such pain. If you’re staying home from work, if you’re staying home from school, that is not normal and you need to speak up and you need to ask your physicians to take you seriously. And what happened afterwards was kind of amazing. Because hundreds, maybe even thousands of young people started coming to my concerts and coming to my meet and greets and telling me that because I drew their attention to endometriosis they were diagnosed and people were catching this disease and young people who were 16, 17, 18 years old, which means there was so much hope for them. There was hope for them to not live a life that was not full of pain and this was something they wouldn’t have known about if I didn't post a tweet one day. ; And it seemed so simple but it was a scary thing to do because as soon as I did it, oh boy, did the world flock in. Everyone wanted to know, who was the father of the baby that I miscarried, was I ever going to be able to have kids, does this mean I was infertile, what is endometriosis. Everyone just wanted to pick and pick and pick apart of me and I was already feeling very, very vulnerable. Part of endometriosis is that it can feel like a direct attack on your womanhood. I was very fatigued and was fainting backstage at my concerts and I was bleeding and I was pissed off at the whole world. I was like, why is this happening to me? What did I do to deserve this? My god! Just because I had sex before marriage, this is what I get, seriously? Because I will take it all back, I really will. ; But in the process of having everyone pick me apart and feeling so insecure, feeling less of a woman 'cause I couldn't be intimate with my boyfriend, because I couldn't go out when my friends wanted me to, because I was dealing with digestion problems, and bleeding problems and fainting and all of the other amazing things that come along with having endo. It was really hard to feel like that confident, 20 something-year-old girl who wanted to get on the stage with her middle finger held high and make everyone sing along with her. I had surgery a year ago in January and since then, I have felt a lot better. I really have. I had the laparoscopic diagnostic surgery and endometriosis ablation. And I walked the red carpet at the Grammy’s with stitches in my stomach. There is that. And I have made a lot of friends now that I am able to go out and do stuff. I am in a new relationship with someone that loves me and understands me and is passionate and caring about what I have gone through but I still wake up every day and I am scared that if I become that sick girl again that all of those people will go away. That fear, it's gonna haunt me for the rest of my life, that if I get sick again, if I get bad like I was, that my friends aren’t going to understand, that my partner is not going to understand, that everybody is going to give up on me because I am a lot easier to deal with when I am healthy than I am when I am sick. ; But it’s being places like here and hearing the stories of other women who have been through what I have been through and seeing the smiles on their face and watching them walk in beautiful dresses. And watching them be here with their children, their miracle children that they are so happy to have. It's these experiences that give me hope and make me proud to be sharing my story and knowing that because I am talking about it and because I am not ashamed of it, and because I am proud of it that more women are in this world hopefully can catch their diagnosis early or wake up one day and realize that the pain they're living with is not normal and that hopefully they can live a pain free life because of it. And I hope that more attention will come to research, to treatment because 1 in 10 women is way too fucking many. ; You have to forgive me, I'm emotional and also obviously very hormonal so. I knew I was going to cry. I am really lucky, I get on stage every night in a little white costume mind you and I work my ass off and to any of my fans and friends and people listening to me who may not know anything about me or never heard a song, if you’re struggling with endometriosis or any chronic illness for that matter, you need to know it’s not something that it’s not something that makes you weak. It’s a battle that you've overcome and every battle that you’re in helps you win the war at the end of the day. Keep talking to your friends, keep supporting your loved ones, to the women in your life, make sure that they don’t feel ashamed to talk about their reproductive rights, to talk about their reproductive experiences, because the only way for this—for us to gain control of this—is to speak about it. I am so honored to be here and to be supporting my endo sisters in the room, around the world, I can’t thank you guys enough. Keep fucking fighting."

Nina oh, won't you leave me now ; Now ; And every weekend in the winter ; You'd be wearing my hoodie ; With draw strings pulled tight ; To keep your face from the cold ; Taking day trips to the local ; Where we'd eat on our own ; Cause every day when I was away ; We'd only speak on the phone ; Watching Blue Planet ; Creating new habits ; Then as if we were two rabbits ; And then you'd vanish back to the burrow with all the Celtics ; I disappear ; You call me selfish, I understand ; But I can't help it ; I put my job over everything ; Except my family and friends ; But you'll be in between forever ; So I guess we'll have to take a step back ; Overlook the situation ; Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications ; And I'm not saying we should be taking a break ; Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it's too late ; So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on the plane ; But in a day we'll have to say it again ; Oh Nina ; You should go Nina ; 'Cause I ain't never coming home ; Nina oh, won't you leave me now ; And I've been living on the road Nina ; But then again you should know Nina ; Cause that's you and me both Nina ; Uh won't you leave me now ; Now ; Love will come and love will go ; But you can make it on your own ; Sing that song, go, oh won't you leave me now ; People grow, and fall apart ; But you can mend your broken heart ; Take it back, go, oh won't you leave me now ; Oh Nina ; You should go Nina ; 'Cause I ain't never coming home ; Nina oh, won't you leave me now ; And I've been living on the road Nina ; And then again you should know Nina ; Cause that's you and me ; Both in a road, won't you leave me now ; Now"
